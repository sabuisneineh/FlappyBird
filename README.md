# FlappyBird
# Credit to Zigurous... I followed a tutorial on his YouTube and used his images provided.

# I had orginally planned to make Flappy Dragon. t's the same thing as Flappy Bird, except the image is just a dragon. I had trouble trying to find the right images, so I went back to Flappy Bird for my final project.

# If I had more time (and skills), I would've added sound, and something where you can change the bird color.
